# Archy

Note: This is not an open source project (yet), this repo is for issue tracking and main entry point for developers.

## We in Private Beta! Join now.

- go to https://archy.ai and signup to private beta to invite to test our iOS app.


## How it works?

Archy.ai is a platform for developers.

1. Developer codes a simple http server that returns json (see examples below)
2. Connect it to Archy.ai
3. Archy generates user interface, available through Archy Client.
4. User downloads Archy client and developer's integrations.

## How interface will look? 

Example of simple integration with BetaList:
