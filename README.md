## How does it work?

Archy.ai is a platform for developers.

1. Developer codes a simple http server that returns json (see examples below)
2. Connect it to Archy.ai
3. Archy generates user interface, available through Archy Client.
4. User downloads Archy client and developer's integrations.

## Demo. How it works

Example of simple integration with BetaList:
